# EXP 5: Comparative Analysis of Naïve Prompting versus Basic Prompting Using ChatGPT Across Various Test Scenarios

# Aim:
To test how ChatGPT responds to naïve prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios, analyzing the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

# Algorithm:
## 1.Define the Two Prompt Types:

• Naïve Prompts: Vague, open-ended, or broad prompts with minimal context.

• Basic Prompts: Structured, specific, and detailed prompts designed to guide the model effectively.

## 2.Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:

• Creative Story Generation

• Factual Question Answering

• Concept Summarization

• Advice/Recommendation

• Dialogue Simulation

## 3.Run Experiments Using ChatGPT:

• Input the naïve prompt → Record response.

• Input the corresponding basic prompt → Record response.

• Repeat for all scenarios.

## 4.Evaluate Responses:

• Compare for Quality, Accuracy, and Depth.

• Note differences or similarities.

• Identify which type of prompting gives better results for each case.

### Analysis:
• Quality: Basic prompts consistently generated more structured, engaging, and usable content.

• Accuracy: Basic prompts directed the model to give precise answers. Naïve prompts often produced vague or overly broad responses.

• Depth: In all scenarios except very simple or creative ones, basic prompts led to deeper, more thoughtful responses.

### Summary of Findings:
• Prompt Clarity Greatly Impacts Output: Clear, structured prompts help ChatGPT deliver better, more relevant results.

• Naïve Prompts Have Limited Use: They may work in very open-ended, creative scenarios but often lack depth.

### Best Practices:

• Define task clearly.

• Include format constraints (word count, bullet points, etc.).

• Add tone or role guidance (e.g., “explain to a child”, “respond as a doctor”).

# Result:
The prompt for the above said problem executed successfully. ChatGPT responded more effectively to basic prompts, confirming that well-structured inputs yield better outputs in terms of quality, clarity, and relevance.
